After searching far and wide, all it took was a quick email to Yorkshire Tea themselves to find the answer:-

## Meidiya 明治屋

But only some stores:-

- [Meidi-Ya Kyōbashi Store](https://goo.gl/maps/2Vt3sR5K1TMcxik39)
- [Meidi-Ya Tamagawa Store](https://goo.gl/maps/Qd5TTfohiWdxArf78)
- [Meidi-Ya Kichijoji Store](https://goo.gl/maps/rEvWZVYVYT8mBBfm8)
- [Meidi-Ya Roppongi Store](https://goo.gl/maps/ur3cDc8qTYBP2Nji6)
- [Meidi-Ya Hiroo Store](https://goo.gl/maps/kemzASbPknr55FUq9)

I topped up at Kyobashi.

**¥950 for 40 tea bags** include tax (¥880 without tax):-

You can also order online from the distributor or if you are happy to buy in bulk and wait a month or more, there are some sellers on Amazon and Rakuten who important it from the UK or US.
