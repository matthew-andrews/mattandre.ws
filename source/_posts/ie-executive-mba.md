I just graduated from IE Business School's **Executive MBA** programme in Madrid, Spain.

The 15 month programme was conducted mostly **online** so I took most of the classes crouched over my laptop in the dead of the night from my adopted home in Tokyo, Japan.

Here's me happily accepting my certificate:

A colleague of mine asked me today:

> (How) do you think it has been valuable for you?

Before I answer I want to first write a short **disclaimer**.

MBAs are **very expensive**, many are designed for a world that is increasingly **[out of date](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/10/31/the-future-of-management-education)** and I am certain **free or low cost online equivalents** of the vast majority of the course content now exist on Udemy, YouTube, Coursera, etc. _I often joked a Harvard Business Review subscription gives you a third of the value of an MBA with less than 1% of the cost._

For me I was extremely fortunate in three ways:

- Firstly, my employer chose me as one of the three candidates they put forward each year for full sponsorship.
- Secondly, **I joined IE**: an incredibly forward-thinking school who have technology capable of running truly collaborative and engaging classes connecting teachers and students across all the world's populated continents at once.
- Finally, almost **everything we learnt was new to me**. I believe had I already studied business at undergraduate level and complemented it with relevant work experience, I would have got much less out of it.

Your mileage may vary.

## (How) has an MBA been valuable for me?

- Before, I might think of an idea for a business and fantasise it would make me a gazillionaire. Now, I feel I know more clearly than ever what needs to be done to take that idea, **evaluate its potential**, make decisions about the trade-offs between various ways of getting it **funded**, and how it might be brought to life. _I also realise **how much work and risky it is** — and now feel almost (but not quite) all of my previous ideas lack the potential to make them worth the effort._
- I can now read & understand **basic financial statements**, but despite having a numerical background (BSc Mathematics) I'm not as good at it as I thought I would be.
- But I realised **I can write quite well**. I guess 8 years working for a newspaper has had some effect!
- I learnt how to make a **marketing plan** … and made a basic one for part of my current project at the FT (and it was received well!)
- I learnt what is considered [best](https://www.amazon.com/Manager-as-Negotiator-David-Lax/dp/1451636490) [practice](https://hbr.org/2001/04/six-habits-of-merely-effective-negotiators) when _Negotiating_ … and now use this in my daily life all the time …
- Studying _IT/Technology_ from an academic & business perspective made me re-realise I'm really good at it and absolutely love it.
- On the other side, it's given me a much greater respect for those ‘from the business side’. _Finance, Strategy, Sales, Marketing_ are crafts in their own right and are in my opinion far more difficult than the likes of IT and operations. Why/what questions are infinitely more difficult to answer than who/how.
- I learnt what _Networking_ actually is and realised I'm not as bad at it and enjoy it much more than I thought.
- It will help the next step of my career — to move into **product** focused technology roles.
- And finally, I've met a bunch of **wonderful people doing crazy amazing things** around the world and I'm looking forward to joining them at it some point very soon!
