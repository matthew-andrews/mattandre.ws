I recently attended [Big Data Analytics Tokyo](http://www.bigdatacon.jp/).

Here are my honest and unfiltered notes from the talks I attended on day 2:-

### ConceptNet: Teaching Machine Common Sense

[Overview](http://www.bigdatacon.jp/en/talk/conceptnet-teaching-machines-common-sense/) - [Slides](https://s3.amazonaws.com/big-data-tokyo/Havasi-Luminoso-2017-02.pdf)

Probably the best, most useful talk of the two days.

- AI.  For the [AlphaGo example](https://www.ft.com/content/f6b90460-eaa5-11e5-9fca-fb0f946fd1f0) after the team taught the computer several million example go games, they got the computer to play itself.  This doesn't work for language.
- An introduction to [ConceptNet](https://blog.conceptnet.io/) — a huge user generated set of timeless facts database that can help computers gain ‘common sense’.
- Useful things: [Numberbatch](), [GloVe](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), [Word2vec](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec/)

### Machine Intelligence at Google Scale

[Overview](http://www.bigdatacon.jp/en/talk/machine-intelligence-at-google-scale/)

- Things: [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), big query, neural network, deep learning, …
- Inbox (the Google app) now offers ‘smart replies’ based on the contents of emails.
- Artifical intelligence written music …
