This is second weekly note of my weekly Week Notes. [Why not read post one first?](https://mattandre.ws/2020/05/week-notes-1/)

### Non-alcohol

Thursday 21st May marked 5 months since I gave up alcohol. I miss it far less than I expected. Partly because I feel so much healthier and partly because I've found some really excellent alternatives to alcoholic drinks (I have comprehensively reviewed the ones available in Japan here: [https://mattandre.ws/nonalcoholic](https://mattandre.ws/nonalcoholic))

### Website restructure

Observant viewers may have noticed I have reorganised my website a little bit.

- The home page, which used to show all my newest posts, will now only show ones I've chosen to feature.
- There's a new section “All Posts”, which is the full unfiltered feed.

I've done this because there are some posts (like [my negotiation article](https://mattandre.ws/2020/01/8-tips-for-better-negotiation/)) that I spent a lot of time on, am genuinely quite proud of. But sometimes I just note down coding tips or personal thoughts like these Week Notes that, frankly speaking, would be better less read.

With this change I hope to create far more content on topics of personal interest to me, without (hopefully) drowning out the good stuff.

### Alan Parsons

Speaking of subtle, almost inconsequential changes, I noticed that the music being played in my local 7-11 that always seemed to have been a cheap synthesiser version of The Monkee's classic “Cheer Up, Sleepy Jean”, has been replaced by a less irritating piano rendition of the far more obscure Alan Parson’s “Eye In The Sky”.

I’ve actually seen that song being performed live by Alan Parsons, at a gig in Shepherd’s Bush, which I went to with my parents. That same night I took them to one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in London and introduced them to authentic Peking Duck (none of this Crispy Fried Duck rubbish), which they liked a lot, and Jellyfish, which they liked a little less.

I miss live music.

### Into The Night

Reading books, cooking, running and Netflix are now what we've been doing ‘for fun’ during this pandemic.

I used to joke that after finishing my MBA (last December) I planned to spend the whole of January in my underwear watching Netflix. It seems very hollow now we're all locked at home hiding from the virus with not a lot else to do.

Over this week we watched “Into the Night”, the new Belgian series on Netflix where the sun's rays have turned deadly and a group of survivors, each with dark and troubled personal histories, use an airliner to try to outrun them by flying west *into the night*. Lord of the flies meets Lost meets Speed. It's utterly ridiculous. Unbelievable. Full of plot holes. Way too overdramatic. But it's awesome and you should definitely watch it.
